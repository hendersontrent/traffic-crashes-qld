## QLD Traffic Crash Statisical Modelling Tool
***

### What is this application?

This is a web application created to enable interactive statistical modelling of traffic crash data from the [Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/crash-data-from-queensland-roads).


### How do I use it?

Navigate through the app using the tabs at the top. Further details and instructions are provided on each tab. A high level overview of what each does presented below:

* __STATISTICAL MODELLING__ Presents user-driven statistical analysis and modelling of time-series and cross-sectional data.


### Who made it?

This application was built by Trent Henderson of [Orbisant Analytics](https://www.orbisantanalytics.com/). Trent is a data scientist from Brisbane, Australia, and can be found on Twitter [@trentlikesstats](https://twitter.com/trentlikesstats) or by [email](trent.henderson1@outlook.com).


### Where did the data come from?

All data is sourced from the [Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/crash-data-from-queensland-roads).


### How can I log an issue or contribute?

If you have a GitHub account, you can log an issue or contribute to application development at the [repository](https://github.com/hendersontrent/traffic-crashes-qld).

### What are the future plans for the application?

To make the application more dynamic, include more statistical models, and use more interactive plotting features (i.e. JavaScript-communicating libraries such as [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)).
